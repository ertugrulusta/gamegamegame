# Project - Part 1

The objective of the first part of the project is to design a game following object-oriented design principles. You are expected to write an analysis report as a group and upload it to Moodle. Your analysis report will have: 
* A Cover Page (with Group Number) 
* A Contents Page 
* A brief description of the game 
* Class diagrams (drawn on a software like draw.io, Modelio, Visio, Smart Draw etc.) 
  -	Explanation of the classes and relations among them. 
  -	Do not forget to include relation cardinalities, directions, and roles. 
  -	You must use Association / Aggregation and Inheritance relations; you can use composition but not necessary 
* Use-case diagram (drawn on a software like draw.io, Modelio, Visio, Smart Draw etc.) - Detailed explanation of the use-cases. 
 
You are also expected to provide a code consisting of only declarations of classes (with necessary inheritance relationships) according to class diagrams you created. Your code and class diagrams should conform in all aspects. You can enter pass statements under classes for now. Your code is not expected to perform anything, but it should be free from errors. You are expected to finalize your code on GitHub by the deadline.

Please be careful with indentations, captions, page numbers, etc. in your report. Please use good English and spell-check before you submit. You should include references if you have any.
